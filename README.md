# Nice Weather

Welcome to the Nice Weather app! This application is a simple program to show the current weather and a 5 day forecast. It is fairly bare-bones but has plenty of room to expand.

## How it Works

Making use of the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), this app makes calls to the API to pull daily and weekly forecasts based on a city the user searches for. For example, searching for Denver will pull up the Denver local weather information. The user can then search for a new city and the app will make a new call and update the front-end. 

## Examples

## Where to Now?

For future development, I would like to finish implementing a working search history with local storage as well as improve the layout and the style to be more appealing and not so minimalist. Also to display more data from the call without crowding the cards.
